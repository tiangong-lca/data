lastReviewedNote: "Reviewed for Data #31: active canonicalRepo is tiangong-lca/data. Dataset/schema/style payloads and archived release metadata remain unchanged; publish.yml remains a retired read-only notice. Governance validation is scoped to the sparse metadata checkout and does not claim full dataset clone verification."

# data Validation Guide

This repository is content-oriented and does not currently define a single checked-in green-bar wrapper such as `npm test`, `cargo test`, or `pytest`.

## Required Validation Shape

- Data payload changes require direct review of the touched files under `tiangong_lca_data/**`.
- Schema and stylesheet changes require reviewing the affected bundled assets and any data-package expectations they imply.
- Release metadata changes require checking that `release.json`, `release_notes/v<version>.md`, and the archived data snapshot agree. GitHub Release publishing must remain disabled.
- Documentation-governance changes require docpact validation.

## Docpact Validation

Run these commands for governance changes:

```bash
scripts/docpact validate-config --root . --strict
scripts/docpact lint --root . --base origin/main --head HEAD --mode enforce
```

The manual `ai-doc-lint` workflow delegates to the same local docpact gate when remote reproduction is needed.

## Future Automation

If this repository gains a canonical data validation wrapper later, update this file, `AGENTS.md`, and `.docpact/config.yaml` in the same change. The current publish workflow is a retired release notice, not release automation or a general data validation wrapper.

## Local Docpact Push Gate

Install the versioned local hook once per checkout:

```bash
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

The `pre-push` hook runs `scripts/docpact-gate.sh`, which delegates CLI lookup to `scripts/docpact` and performs strict config validation plus enforced lint before the push leaves the machine. The wrapper checks `DOCPACT_BIN`, Cargo install locations, Homebrew install locations, and then `PATH`, so local agent shells should not fail only because bare `docpact` is unavailable. The default comparison base is `origin/main`. Override it for unusual stacks with `DOCPACT_BASE_REF=<ref>` or `scripts/docpact-gate.sh --base <ref>`. The gate writes its detailed report to a temporary file so normal pushes do not create `.docpact/runs/` artifacts.
